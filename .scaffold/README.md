# README

FE Scaffold supply additional functions than official angular cli. This document describe its design and usage.


## Usage

### The boilerplates

In `./boilerplates` folder, it store some reference files, here is some descriptions for them

- package.yml A sample to define 'scaffold' property
  - rootDir: set the scaffold system root dir
  - projectCofnigDir: set the folder which to used to store generated 'project-config.json' file
  - projectConfigFilesDir: set the folder which contains 'project-configs/'

- config/
  - angular/ the Angular project config files. The official ng cli create them in the root folder to make too many files
  - docker/ docker file for web app
  - nginx/ nginx config file for web app
  - project-configs/ As Interface used by scaffold. scaffold will merge them and generate to 'project-config.json' in
    - Scaffold defines the config schema in `config/project-config.schema.yml`
  - publish Define the folder to store some assets files which need to be packaged into web app
  - i18n-langs.js Define the i18n language configs
  - sonar[6].properties the sonarqube project config files

- gulpfile.js Gulp tasks to call methods supplied by scaffold

- jsconfig.json Used in VS Code to tell it some project's configuration

- src/
  - tsconfig.json This file is needed by sonar-scanner 6+

- script/
  - generate-env-variables.sh A bash script used to generate environment variables Used in Jenkins build job
  - prepare.sh A bash script used to handle git submodules first step after clone

### Recommended steps

- In your project's package.json, add the 'scaffold' property and its values

```
  "scaffold": {
    "rootDir": "./.scaffold",
    "projectConfigDir": "./config",
    "projectConfigFilesDir": "./config/project-configs"
  },
```

The values is according to your real situation.

- Create 'config/' folder in the root of your project folder

  - copy `./boilerplates/config/*` into `config/`

- Copy below files into the root of your project
  - `gulpfile.js`
  - `jsconfig.json`
  - `script/` folder

- Modify `angular.json` in your project root folder, according to `./boilerplates/angular.json`, because ng cli config files are in `config/angular/` now

- Clear the generated config files generated by ng cli

- In the scaffold folder, execute `yarn|npm install`
